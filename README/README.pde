/*
     These are the Intro_To_Processing program files which were made to serve as a basic tutorial for
   anyone who wants to learn Processing. Originally these were made to supplement a Presentation but 
   have since been modified to be standalone content. This way anyone can work through these tutorials 
   by themselves.
   
   A rudimentary background in Computer Science (having completed CSCE 145) is assumed for these tutorials however 
   they have been commented to explain what is going on in the hopes that it helps those without the proper
   background.
   
   These tutorials are written in Processing: Java which is technically a seperate language but contains so much
   simalarity to Java it might as well be the same thing. Any differences between Processing: Java and Java are
   for the most part mentioned when encountered in this tutorial.
   
   Below are important terms which will be used in the tutorials which relate to Processing itself. There are also
   useful links for Processing, Nature of Code, The Coding Train etc.


Terminology

  * Sketch -> The name for a project in Processing. This is the "README" sketch.
  
  * Canvas -> The window where shapes and objects are drawn too. Appears when the play button is 
              pressed.
              
  * Tab -> The name for the different sections of a sketch shown near the top. For example, this tab is the 
           README tab. (Not to be confused with the sketch which is also called README)
